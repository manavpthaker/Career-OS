# LinkedIn Post: Career-OS Launch (Enhanced Version)

**PART 2: I built an open-source toolkit to automate the soul-crushing parts of job searching**

After my "Perpetual Day One" post, dozens of PMs reached out. Half were in similar situations. The other half were hiring managers saying "we're different" (narrator: they weren't).

I spent 4 weeks building what I wished I had during my search.

**THE PROBLEM WITH MODERN JOB SEARCHING**

Applied to 50+ roles. Each one wanted:
- A "tailored" cover letter (that they'd skim for 6 seconds)
- A "customized" resume (to get past ATS keywords)
- Proof I understood their "unique" challenges (they weren't unique)

3-4 hours per application. For a 10% response rate.

The math: 150+ hours for 5 interviews.

There had to be a better way.

**INTRODUCING CAREER-OS: AUTOMATE THE REPETITIVE, KEEP THE STRATEGIC**

What it actually does:
- Analyzes job postings for what they REALLY want (not just listed requirements)
- Generates tailored resumes that match their language (without lying about experience)
- Writes cover letters that connect your actual experience to their specific needs
- Reviews quality before you submit (honest scoring of fit)

What it doesn't do:
- Auto-submit applications (you review everything)
- Fabricate experience (uses your real background)
- Guarantee interviews (improves odds, not magic)

**THE ADHD HYPERFOCUS THAT BUILT THIS**

My ADHD hyperfocus kicked in: 4 weeks, 200+ hours, 6 specialized agents.
When neurodivergent brains find a problem worth solving, we don't just solve it—we systematize it.

Built with: Python, Claude API, Beautiful Soup, async patterns
Why these? They're accessible to PMs who code occasionally, not just engineers.

**THE 3-LAYER APPROACH**

Layer 1: Just Prompts (5 minutes)
- Copy engineered prompts to Claude/ChatGPT
- Paste job posting + your background
- Get strategic analysis and tailored materials

Layer 2: Claude Code Automation (30 minutes)
- Interactive setup builds your professional narrative
- One command generates full application package
- No Python skills needed with Claude Code

Layer 3: Full Orchestrator (2+ hours)
- 6 specialized agents for different parts of the process
- Batch processing for multiple applications
- Advanced positioning strategies by role level

**REAL RESULTS FROM MY JOB SEARCH**

Before Career-OS:
- 3-4 hours per application
- 10% response rate
- Generic positioning
- Exhausted after 3 applications

After Career-OS:
- 30 minutes per application (including review)
- Better targeted roles (not claiming 25% yet - still testing)
- Strategic positioning for each role
- Could do 5 quality applications per day

**REAL TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLE**

Senior PM role at Series B marketplace:

Before: Generic "I love marketplaces and have built products" cover letter

After: Connected my 70% retention achievement (vs 30% industry standard) to their specific churn challenge mentioned in their investor deck. Referenced their exact payment flow problem I'd solved before.

Result: Interview within 48 hours. They said my application "felt inevitable."

**THE STRATEGIC INSIGHTS THAT EMERGED**

Building this taught me what actually matters:

Hidden requirements decoder:
- "Fast-paced" = chaotic, prepare for ambiguity
- "Wear many hats" = unclear scope, probe in interviews
- "Entrepreneurial" = no process, you'll build it
- "Collaborative" = decision by committee, clarify ownership

Language patterns that get responses:
- Mirror their exact terms for technical concepts
- Use their metrics format (MoM vs QoQ)
- Match their formality level
- Reference their actual products/features

**OPEN SOURCE AND HONEST**

It's all on GitHub. Free. No catches.

Why? Because job searching already costs enough - time, energy, dignity. The tools to do it better shouldn't cost extra.

Built in public with:
- Zero personal data (all examples anonymized)
- Clear documentation (actually readable)
- Progressive complexity (start simple, add as needed)
- Honest limitations (this isn't magic)

**THE CODE PHILOSOPHY**

"Layer it up, don't dumb it down"

Beginners can copy-paste prompts in 5 minutes.
Power users get a full 6-agent orchestrator.
Everyone gets value at their comfort level.

**WHO THIS IS FOR**

You, if you're:
- Tired of writing "I'm passionate about your mission" for the 50th time
- A PM who'd rather build systems than repeat tasks
- Someone who knows their value but struggles with positioning
- Ready to be strategic about job searching, not just busy

Not for you if you:
- Want to auto-spam applications
- Think AI should write everything with no review
- Need guarantees (job searching has no guarantees)
- Prefer doing things manually (respect)

**WHAT'S IN THE REPO**

```
career-os/
├── prompts/          # Copy-paste to Claude/ChatGPT
├── automation/       # 30-min setup scripts
├── templates/        # Fill-in-the-blank narratives
├── examples/         # Real applications (anonymized)
└── advanced/         # Full orchestrator system
```

Everything you need to stop spending 4 hours on applications that get 6 seconds of review.

**THE REAL LESSON**

My "Perpetual Day One" experience sucked. But it forced me to get strategic about job searching.

This toolkit is the system I wish I'd had from day 1.

Now it's yours.

**BTW**: I'm using this tool in my own search for Director/Principal Product roles at marketplaces and AI-forward companies. The strategic positioning works.

**For job seekers**: What's your biggest application pain point?
**For hiring managers**: What actually makes you read an application?
**For builders**: What would you add to this?

P.S. - The irony isn't lost on me that I automated job searching after leaving a role for too much chaos. Sometimes the best systems come from the worst experiences.

P.P.S. - If you're hiring: I still review every application Career-OS generates. The human judgment is what makes it work. The automation just saves time on the repetitive parts.
