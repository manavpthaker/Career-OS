## Requirements

**Every claim must be verifiable** - if you can't prove it, don't include it
**Use specific numbers, not ranges** - "increased by 40%" not "significantly improved"
**Show progression and learning** - demonstrate growth over time
**Authentic voice, not corporate speak** - write like a human, not a job posting
**Address potential gaps honestly** - acknowledge areas for growth
**Focus on outcomes** - impact on business/users, not just deliverables
