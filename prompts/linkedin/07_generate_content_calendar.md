## Example Output (Anonymized):

### Week 1

#### Day 1 (Monday, 10:00 AM EST) - Pattern Recognition Post
**Targets**: [COMPANY_A], [COMPANY_B] (both struggling with retention)

**Post**:
```
[3] marketplaces. Same mistake. Different outcomes.

Company A: Unlimited choice → [30]% retention
Company B: Focused curation → [65]% retention
Company C: AI matching → [72]% retention

We analyzed [375K] transactions to understand why.

The pattern: Paradox of choice isn't just psychology—it's math.

Every +[10] options = -[5]% conversion.
The sweet spot: [7] options, not [47].

What made the difference:
• Curation beats freedom when users are overwhelmed
• Default recommendations drive [3]x engagement
• Fewer, better options = higher trust

The lesson: Your users don't want more features.
They want confidence in their decision.

What patterns have you seen in your products?
```

**Why This Works**:
- Specific numbers ([3] companies, [375K] transactions)
- Directly addresses retention challenges at [COMPANY_A] and [COMPANY_B]
- Shows cross-company pattern recognition
- Invites engagement with question

**Engagement Tactics**:
- Hashtags: #ProductManagement #Retention #Marketplace
- No tags (organic reach)
- If [SENIOR_PM] from [COMPANY_A] comments, respond: "We saw similar at [MY_COMPANY]. Curious if you've tested [SPECIFIC_TACTIC]?"

**Expected Impact**:
- 15-20 profile views from [COMPANY_A]/[COMPANY_B]
- 3-5 thoughtful comments
- Positions you as retention/marketplace expert

---

#### Day 2 (Tuesday, 11:30 AM) - Strategic Engagement

**Action 1: Comment on [SENIOR_PM]'s post about experimentation**
```
This resonates with our experience at [MY_COMPANY]. We tried [50+] A/B tests
in Q1 and found something counterintuitive: smaller tests with tighter hypotheses
outperformed big swings [3]:1.

The key was [SPECIFIC_FRAMEWORK] - test one variable, learn fast, compound
insights. Helped us improve [METRIC] by [XX]%.

Have you found similar results with focused vs broad experiments?
```

**Why**:
- [SENIOR_PM] is active poster, well-connected at [COMPANY_A]
- Adds specific value (not generic praise)
- Invites continued conversation

**Action 2: Connect with [JUNIOR_PM]** (Associate PM at [COMPANY_A])
```
Hi [NAME],

Saw your post about user research challenges and really appreciated your insight
about [SPECIFIC_POINT]. I faced similar obstacles at [MY_COMPANY] and found
[APPROACH] helped us get better signal.

Would love to connect and hear more about your work at [COMPANY_A].

[YOUR_NAME]
```
