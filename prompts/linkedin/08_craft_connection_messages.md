## Customization Guidelines by Seniority:

### Junior ICs (Associate, PM I):
- **Tone**: Peer-to-peer, friendly
- **Focus**: Shared interests, learning together
- **Length**: Can be slightly longer (they have more time)
- **Example**: "Saw you just joined [COMPANY]! I'm also working in [DOMAIN] and would love to connect."

### Mid-Level ICs (PM II, Senior PM):
- **Tone**: Professional peer, mutual respect
- **Focus**: Specific skills/projects, trade insights
- **Length**: Concise, 2-3 sentences
- **Example**: "Your post about [X] resonated. At [COMPANY], we solved similar with [Y]. Would love to compare approaches."

### Senior ICs/Staff (Staff PM, Principal PM):
- **Tone**: Respectful but confident
- **Focus**: Strategic insights, high-level patterns
- **Length**: Very concise, 1-2 sentences
- **Example**: "Impressed by [COMPANY]'s [PROJECT]. I led similar at [MY_COMPANY] and would value your perspective."

### Managers/Directors:
- **Tone**: Professional, value-focused
- **Focus**: Team building, leadership, outcomes
- **Length**: Short, respect their time

### VPs/Executives:

## A/B Test Recommendations:

Try different approaches with similar people and track acceptance rates:

**Test 1: Length**
- Short (1 sentence) vs Medium (2-3 sentences)

**Test 2: Credibility Signal**
- Lead with achievement vs Lead with interest

**Test 3: Call-to-Action**
- "Would love to connect" vs "Would love to compare notes" vs "Would love to learn more"

**Track**:
- Acceptance rate by variation
- Response rate after connection
- Which leads to actual conversations

---

## Red Flags to Avoid:

❌ **"I'm currently looking for opportunities"** (too soon, seems desperate)
❌ **"I'd like to add you to my professional network"** (LinkedIn default = lazy)
❌ **"Can you refer me to..."** (asking favor before relationship)
❌ **Too much flattery** ("You're amazing, I'm a huge fan")
❌ **Too long** (150+ words = they won't read)
❌ **Too vague** ("I work in tech and saw you do too")
❌ **Spelling their name wrong** (instant rejection)

---

## Success Metrics:

Target acceptance rates:
- **Junior ICs**: 80-90% (easier connections)
- **Mid-Level ICs**: 70-80% (peer level)
- **Senior ICs**: 60-70% (more selective)
- **Managers/Directors**: 50-60% (very selective)
- **VPs/Execs**: 30-50% (need strong hook)

If your acceptance rate is below these, review:
- Are you being specific enough?
- Is your profile complete and professional?
- Are you connecting too aggressively (too many/day)?
- Do you have mutual connections?
