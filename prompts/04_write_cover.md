## Avoid These Red Flags

❌ **Generic openings**: "I am writing to express my interest..."
❌ **Fake passion**: "I've always been passionate about your mission..."
❌ **Obvious templating**: Could be sent to any company
❌ **Overselling**: Claims that sound too good to be true
❌ **Desperate language**: "It would be an honor..." or "Please consider..."
❌ **Repeating resume**: Just listing same achievements differently
❌ **Length issues**: Either too short (under 200 words) or too long (over 500)
