# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# 1. Track ALL target companies and interactions in this spreadsheet
# 2. Update "Touchpoints" every time you interact (like, comment, share, message, etc.)
# 3. "Last Interaction" should always reflect your most recent engagement
# 4. "Interaction Type" helps track what's working (connections vs comments vs emails)
# 5. Update "Status" as things progress (Warming Up → Applied → Interview Scheduled → Offer, etc.)
# 6. Use "Notes" to track what resonated, what didn't, context for next interaction
# 7. Review weekly: What's working? Where are you stuck? What needs follow-up?
#
# TOUCHPOINT TYPES TO TRACK:
# - Connection request sent
# - Connection accepted
# - Post liked
# - Post commented on
# - Content shared (yours or theirs)
# - Email sent
# - Phone/voicemail left
# - InMail sent
# - Coffee chat scheduled
# - Referral received
#
# SUCCESS METRICS TO MONITOR:
# - Connection acceptance rate (target: 70%+)
# - Average touchpoints before application (target: 5-7)
# - Response rate to applications after warming (target: 15-20%)
# - Time from first contact to interview (track for optimization)
# - Which interaction types correlate with success
